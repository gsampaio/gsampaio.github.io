Since I started learning [ReactiveCocoa](http://github.com) I come across a lot of `@weakify` and `@strogify` used on the blocks to prevent retain cycles. At first I adopted that this always worked, but now I digged into the implementation of those macros and found out how they actually work, and that's what we are going to talk about now.
<br/><br/>
Before moving forward lets understand were those macro come from. Both are defined on the libextobjc created by jspahrsummers. And since ReactiveCocoa depends on this library that were get all the magic. To use this library just add the dependency to `pod 'libextobjc'` on your Podfile or follow the manual instructions on the Github repository. If you are using ReactiveCocoa you dont need to do anything.

## @weakify

Lets understand what ```@weakify(self)``` do. To do so first we open the `EXTScope.h` file you will this find the macro definition that I'll paste below.

{% highlight objc %}
#define weakify(...) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    metamacro_foreach_cxt(ext_weakify_,, __weak, __VA_ARGS__)
{% endhighlight %}

Following the macro definition we need to understand what the `metamacro_foreach_cxt` macro do. So lets jump right into this macro definition.

{% highlight objc %}
#define metamacro_foreach_cxt(MACRO, SEP, CONTEXT, ...) \
        metamacro_concat(metamacro_foreach_cxt, metamacro_argcount(__VA_ARGS__))(MACRO, SEP, CONTEXT, __VA_ARGS__)

{% endhighlight %}

Well thats doesn't help a lot, so lets move to the `metamacro_concat` macro and see what it does.

{% highlight objc %}
#define metamacro_concat(A, B) \
        metamacro_concat_(A, B)
#define metamacro_concat_(A, B) A ## B
{% endhighlight %}

Okay, thats easy to understand, this macro basically concatenate the value A and B passed as parameter resulting `AB`. So lets move to the `metamacro_argcount` and see whats the result
{% highlight objc %}
/**
 * Returns the number of arguments (up to twenty) provided to the macro. At
 * least one argument must be provided.
 *
 * Inspired by P99: http://p99.gforge.inria.fr
 */
#define metamacro_argcount(...) \
        metamacro_at(20, __VA_ARGS__, 20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

We dont need see all the `metamacro_at` to understand that this macro counts the number of parameters the macro receive. The comments are clear enough. So lets evaluate the value passed on the `metamacro_concat`.

{% highlight objc %}
metamacro_concat(metamacro_foreach_cxt, metamacro_argcount(self))
metamacro_concat(metamacro_foreach_cxt, 1)
metamacro_foreach_cxt1
{% endhighlight %}

Great now we know that the rest of the parameters of `metamacro_foreach_cxt` is passed to the `metamacro_foreach_cxt1` macro. Evaluating the rest of the expression we are going to have the following code

{% highlight objc %}
weakify(self) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    metamacro_foreach_cxt1(ext_weakify_,, __weak, self)

{% endhighlight %}

Digging the implementation of `metamacro_foreach_cxt1` we find this given implementation.

{% highlight objc %}
#define metamacro_foreach_cxt1(MACRO, SEP, CONTEXT, _0) MACRO(0, CONTEXT, _0)
{% endhighlight %}

Evaluating the weakify with the definition of `metamacro_foreach_cxt1` we have:

{% highlight objc %}
weakify(self) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    ext_weakify_(0, __weak, self)
{% endhighlight %}

Lastly we look for the ext_weakify_ definition and evaluate it on our weakify.

{% highlight objc %}
#define ext_weakify_(INDEX, CONTEXT, VAR) \
    CONTEXT __typeof__(VAR) metamacro_concat(VAR, _weak_) = (VAR);

weakify(self) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    __weak __typeof__(self) metamacro_concat(self, _weak_) = self;

weakify(self) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    __weak __typeof__(self) self_weak_ = self;

{% endhighlight %}

So great, now we know that the libextobjc uses the @autoreleasepool instruction just to get the `@` symbol and then create a `self_weak_` variable with the typeof self, just as we would normally do.
<br/> <br/>
Lastly before we move on to the `@strongify` explanation, we can use the same macro to create multiple weak variables, in case we had something like `@weakify(foo, bar)` we would have a call to `metamacro_foreach_ctx2` that would make two weak variables at the end of the process resulting.

{% highlight objc %}
weakify(foo, bar) \
    autoreleasepool {} \
    __weak __typeof__(foo) foo_weak_ = foo;
    __weak __typeof__(bar) bar_weak_ = bar;
{% endhighlight %}


## @strongify
