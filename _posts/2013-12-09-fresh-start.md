# A new start for my blog.

During 2011 I started writing posts on my old tumblr blog. I keep doing this for about half an year. I really enjoyed the experience of writing down my thoughts an leave it open on the internet so anyone could read and interact with me. 

As soon as I realised that I enjoyed writing, I started thinking that I would setup a wordpress blog on a virtual machine on a cloud provider to go beyond the tumblr limited scope. **I was wrong**. It took too much time to learn how to use the wordpress, to setup a template and then I released that a lost 6 months to achieve nothing. 

> I know that tumblr is awesome, and really looking back I should kept using it, but since I'm a developer I believe I should go for something I would have more control over. 

So much thing happened on my life during this period that I felt that what I was writing didn't made sense for me anymore. So I decided to move on. Now I'm starting this new blog using [github pages](http://pages.github.com) and the [Lagom Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/swanson/lagom) provided by [Matt Swanson](https://github.com/swanson). So lets see how things will go this time :)
